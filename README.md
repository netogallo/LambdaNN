Lambda Neural Networks
===

This is an implementation of echo state neural networks based on the report [The "echo state" approach to analysing and training recurrent neural networks](http://minds.jacobs-university.de/sites/default/files/uploads/papers/EchoStatesTechRep.pdf) by Herber Jaeger. The purpose of this library is to provide a framework to create, train and run echo state neural networks with time series. This implementation allows networks of various dimensions to be created. It allows the networks to be trained and run with or without noise. The networks can be trained and run by teacher forcing an output signal if desired.

This library is being implemented as part of the work for my bachelor's thesis titled "Classification of Humman Motion using Echo State Neural Networks". The [research proposal](https://github.com/netogallo/LambdaNN/blob/master/Research%20Proposal.pdf) contains detailed information about the work being done.
